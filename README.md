# Vibration Control Project

Vibration modelling for a multiple degrees of freedom system (a structural model of a 3 floor building). This was developed in 2022 as a project from Vibration Control discipline from Federal University of Santa Catarina's Mechanical Engineering course.

In the project, we used experimental data obtained with an impact hammer to determine the natural frequency vibration of the structure.
